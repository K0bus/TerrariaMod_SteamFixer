Steam Achievement Fix is a small but powerful mod that re-implements vanilla steam achievements in tModLoader.

What this means is that when you get an ingame achievement in a modded world, the achievement will carry over to vanilla Terraria on Steam - so you get the credit you deserve!

Version 1.4: Thanks entirely to K0bus, the mod should now keep track of achievement progress properly.

Features:
- Automatically grants all completed achievements in tModLoader to Terraria when loading a world, or on recieving the achievement.
- Maintains your progress across both Terraria on Steam and tModLoader ingame.
- Adds a command that refreshes achievement progress, in case they don't register (/saf push).
- Adds a command that pull achievement progress from the public steam profile page, and complete all uncompleted game achievements (/saf pull).

Notes:
- Recommend backing up your save files before use to ensure your progress remains safe.
- Be patient, Terraria achievements will be loaded on Steam once you close the game.
- For pulling Steam achievements in your Terraria save, you need to make your profile page public due to some steam limitations.
