Tired of losing your hard-earned tModLoader achievements when switching back to Steam Terraria? This mod seamlessly imports your tModLoader achievements into your Steam Terraria profile, allowing you to continue your progress without missing a single milestone.

[h3]Features:[/h3]

- Automatically grants all completed achievements in tModLoader to Terraria when loading a world, or on recieving the achievement.
- Maintains your progress across both Terraria on Steam and tModLoader ingame.
- Adds a command that refreshes achievement progress, in case they don't register (/pushallachievements).
- Adds a command that pull achievement progress from the public steam profile page, and complete all uncompleted game achievements (/pullsteamachievements).

[h3]Notes:[/h3]

- Recommend backing up your save files before use to ensure your progress remains safe.
- Be patient, Terraria achievements will be loaded on Steam once you close the game.
